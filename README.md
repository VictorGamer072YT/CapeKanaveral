# KSRSS-LaunchSites
A KSP mod for KSRSS 2.5x that recreates Launch Sites.

W.I.P.

## Sites included
- Cape Canaveral

## Planned Sites
- Edwards AFB (Shuttle Landings)
- Vandenberg AFB (Shuttle Landings and Launches, also another rocket which I forgot)
- White Sands Missile Range (Shuttle Landing, also sounding rocket launch site)
- Baikonur Cosmodrome (Vostok, Voshkhod, Soyuz, N1, Energia, Proton, ETC.)
- Certain Shuttle Abort Sites, Specifically the TAL sites, and the West Coast abort sites.
- Possibly an Airport for the people who like to fly planes.

## Requirements
- [CustomPreLaunchChecks](https://github.com/KSP-RO/CustomPreLaunchChecks/releases/tag/1.8.1.1)
- [KerbalKonstructs](https://github.com/KSP-RO/Kerbal-Konstructs/releases/tag/v1.8.3.0)
- [Tundra's Space Center](https://spacedock.info/mod/1831/Tundra's%20Space%20Center)
- [Omega's Stockalike Structures](https://spacedock.info/mod/2061/Omega%27s%20Stockalike%20Structures:%20No%20Textures%20Required)

## Known Bugs
- Putting a craft on LC-39 (A or B, doesn't matter), then returning to the space center, and trying to fly that craft again, will result in a kraken attack ![LC-39B is exploding in the distance, a Saturn V rocket and launch strutucture are being flung.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800087102338891776/898573521347821618/unknown.png) Sometimes it might work, but in most cases, it has ended in disaster.
- The game might consider certain parts of land as being "Splashed".

## Caveats
- The pads have changed over the years, while I've done my best to make sure they can be used by any rocket that ever launched from that particular pad, it isn't perfect, some pads have been changed too much, most of them are in their most famous config, ie, SLC-37B is in the Delta 4/Heavy config, launch the Saturn flights from LC-34. I'm sorry for this, but there isn't much that I can do.
- Some creative liberties have been taken, either due to the lack of pictures, or conflicting information.
- Some pads have been omitted, either due to lack of pictures, never used for any launches, or another site uses the same perimeter.
